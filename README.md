# NestTask App

A modern task management application for students and professionals.

## Features

### Pull-to-Refresh (Mobile)

NestTask now includes a Facebook-style pull-to-refresh feature for mobile users. To refresh your data:

1. On any page displaying tasks or other data (Home, Upcoming, Courses, etc.)
2. Touch your finger to the screen and pull downward
3. A refresh indicator will appear at the top of the screen
4. Pull down until you see "Release to refresh"
5. Let go, and your data will refresh automatically

This feature works in both online and offline modes. When offline, the app will notify you and synchronize your data when you're back online.
